The final edge detection program uses opnecv, it takes up a reference image
and then using homography and canny edge detection, then matches the images using homography, w
we also get a hpomography values matrix at the end. So open cv is a pretty convenient method, 
however the issue is that refercnes will not always be available, and it isnt very fast
So it is needed to use scikit image or skewing the image
The math needs to be simplified
